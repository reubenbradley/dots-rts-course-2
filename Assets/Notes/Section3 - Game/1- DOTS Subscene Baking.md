# DOTS Subscene Baking

## Getting Started

DOTS entities need to be baked into a subscene. Create a new subscene from the Hierarchy window. This will
allow us to add entities to the subscene which are the normal Unity Game Objects.

## Entity Windows
There is an Entities Hierarchy window that can be used to view the entities in the subscene(Window->Entities->Hierarchy).

## Scene View
By default the Scene View will only show the Entities in Authoring Mode. To have the Scene View show 
update during runtime then set Preferences->Entities->Runtime Data
